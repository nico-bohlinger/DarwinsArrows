# DarwinsArrows

## Description
- Hosted: https://darwins-arrows.web.app/
- Target-seeking arrows learn to avoid obstacles or to stay in a predefined track using a genetic algorithm
- Try playing with the sliders for population size, lifespan (max. calculation cycles) and mutation rate to change the settings of the genetic algorithm
- Depending on your screen size and resolution (because of the scaling by the HTML5 canvas) you should change the max. force and max. velocity settings to restrict / open up the speed and manoeuverability of the arrows
- Firstly inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz7mv2vD6g
## Version 1 and 2
- Uses array of vectores as genes for the genetic algorithm
## Version 3
- Uses weights and biases of neural net as genes for the genetic algorithm
